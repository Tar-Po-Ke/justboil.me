Added Image Upload with AWS S3
--------------------------------

# SetUp For S3 in config.php
-----------------------------
$config['img_path'] = '/images'; 
$config['img_path_key'] = 'images';
$config['aws_s3_upload'] = true;

# Upload file will save in your local image path when you use AWS S3. so if don't want it, you can do with $config['local_file_remove'] key that default is false.
$config['local_file_remove'] = true;

# Please Download AWS S3 PHP SDK from this link and place in ci/libraries folder
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.phar

# Replace with Your aws s3 region and aws s3 bucket name in ci/libraries/Awss3functions.php
protected $region = 'your-aws-region';
protected $bucketName = 'your-aws-bucket';

Enjoy... :-)
